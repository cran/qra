                 Changes in qra version 0.1.24 (2018-09-29)

NEW FEATURES
  o The function `getRho()` now has an additional argument
    `varMult`, with default value `FALSE`.  If `TRUE`, a
    list will be returned, with values of `rho` as the first
    element, and values of the multiplier for the binomial
    variance (in terminology used in connection with `glm()`,
    the "dispersion") as the second element.
  o The parameter `scaling` has been changed to `offset`.

BUG FIXES
  o The default for `scaling` (now `offset`) was 1.0, where
  it should have been 1.

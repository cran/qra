Description: Functions are provided that implement the 
    use of the Fieller's formula methodology, for 
    calculating a confidence interval for a ratio of
    (possibly, correlated) means.  See Fieller (1954)
    <doi:10.1111/j.2517-6161.1954.tb00159.x>.  Here,
    the application of primary interest is to studies
    of insect mortality response to increasing doses
    of a fumigant, or, e.g., to time in coolstorage.
    The formula is used to calculate a confidence
    interval for the dose or time required to achieve
    a specified mortality proportion, commonly 0.5 
    or 0.99.  A vignette demonstrates link functions
    that may be considered, and alternative choices of 
    error family.  Note in particular the beta-binomial 
    error family.  See also Maindonald, Waddell, 
    and Petry (2001) <doi:10.1016/S0925-5214(01)00082-5>.
